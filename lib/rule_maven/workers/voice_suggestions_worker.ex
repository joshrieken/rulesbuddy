defmodule RuleMaven.Workers.VoiceSuggestionsWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Durable generation of per-game persona voices from a game's rulebook/theme.
  Writes the result to `game_voices` via `Voices.replace_generated/2` (stable
  slugs keep already-paid restyle caches) and broadcasts `{:voices_ready, defs}`
  on `topic/1` so a mounted show page swaps in the game's themed voices live.

  Mirrors `DidYouKnowWorker`: `unique` per game, survives restarts, no-op in
  test where Oban isn't supervised.
