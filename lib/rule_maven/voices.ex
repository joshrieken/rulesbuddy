defmodule RuleMaven.Voices do
  @moduledoc """
  Persona voices: cached, in-character restyles of canonical answers.

  The canonical answer (the pooled, citation-bearing source of truth) is never
  modified. A voice is a *rendering* of that prose — same facts, same numbers,
  different tone. Each `(answer, voice)` restyle is generated once and cached in
  `answer_voices`, so switching between voices is free after first touch and the
  cache is shared across every viewer.

  The restyler only ever sees the already-grounded answer text — never the
  rulebook — so it cannot introduce new rules. Citations, page numbers, and the
  verdict stamp render from the canonical row and are intentionally left neutral.

  ## Global vs. per-game voices

  There are two sources of voices:

    * **Global** — the built-in `@voices` below, present on every game.
    * **Per-game** — rows in `game_voices`, *generated* from a game's own
      rulebook/theme (see `RuleMaven.Workers.VoiceSuggestionsWorker`) so the
      list feels native to the game. Generated voices only ever ADD to the
      globals; globals are always shown.

  A generated voice's id is namespaced `g:<slug>` so it can never collide with
  a global id. That namespaced id is what lands in `answer_voices.voice`.
