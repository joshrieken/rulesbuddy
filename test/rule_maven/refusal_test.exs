  # ── Test Rulebooks ──

  @rulebook_a """
  SECTION 1: SETUP
  Each player draws 5 cards from the deck. The youngest player goes first.

  SECTION 2: TAKING A TURN
  On your turn, you may either play a card from your hand or draw 2 cards from the deck.
  After playing a card, you must discard one card from your hand.

  SECTION 3: COMBAT
  Combat follows the normal procedure. See Section 7 for the full combat rules.
  When attacked, you may defend by discarding a shield card. See Section 4.3 for shield rules.

  SECTION 4: EQUIPMENT
  4.1 Weapons: Each weapon adds +2 to your attack roll.
  4.2 Armor: Each armor reduces incoming damage by 1.
  4.3 Shields: A shield blocks the first 3 damage each turn. Must be equipped before combat begins.
  Shields cannot be used if you are also carrying a two-handed weapon (see Section 4.1).

  SECTION 5: SCORING
  At the end of the game, red cards are worth 3 points, blue cards 1 point, gold cards 5 points.
  The player with the most points wins.

  SECTION 6: TIE-BREAKING
  In case of a tie in total points, the player with the most gold cards wins.
  If still tied, the player who went last in turn order wins.

  SECTION 7: FULL COMBAT RULES
  Combat is resolved in rounds. Each round, both players roll a d6 and add their weapon bonus (Section 4.1).
  The higher total wins the round and deals 1 point of damage.
  If totals are equal, no damage is dealt.
  """

  @rulebook_b """
  CARD DRAW RULES
  At the start of your turn, draw 1 card from the deck.
  If you have no cards in hand at the start of your turn, draw 3 cards instead.

  MOVEMENT RULES
  You may move up to 4 spaces on your turn.
  If you are on a road space, you may move up to 6 spaces on your turn.

  REVISED RULES ERRATA
  Movement: Starting from the second printing, movement limit is 3 spaces, not 4.
  Road movement is also reduced to 5 spaces.
  This change applies to all games played after Jan 2025.

  SPECIAL ACTIONS
  You may perform one special action per turn. Special actions include:
  Trading with another player on your space, building a structure, or searching the discard pile.

  TRADING CLARIFICATION (FAQ v1.2)
  Trading is only allowed if both players agree and are on the same space.
  You may trade any number of cards or resources.
  Note: Some play groups disallow trading entirely. Check your house rules.
  """

  @rulebook_c """
  GETTING STARTED
  Shuffle the deck and deal 7 cards to each player. Place the remaining cards face down as the draw pile.
  Flip the top card to start the discard pile.

  ON YOUR TURN
  Draw a card from the draw pile. You may then play any number of cards from your hand by placing
  them face up on the table in front of you. Each card has an effect described on the card itself.

  WINNING THE GAME
  The first player to collect 10 victory points wins immediately. Victory points come from card effects.
  Some cards award points when played, some award points at end of game, and some award points conditionally.

  OPTIONAL RULES
  This game supports several optional rules. Players should agree before the game which optional rules
  are in effect. See the official website for the full list of optional rules.
