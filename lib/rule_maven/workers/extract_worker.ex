defmodule RuleMaven.Workers.ExtractWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Durable, on-demand rulebook text extraction.

  Ingest now saves a source without extracting it (`RulebookDownloader.save_source`),
  so a rulebook lands as a `Document` with `pages: []`. This worker runs the
  vision/OCR extraction pipeline for one such document, fills its pages via
  `RulebookDownloader.extract_document/2`, and reports to the unified Jobs log.

  Finishing the run (kind `"extract"`) advances the readiness pipeline centrally
  from `Jobs.finish_run/3`, so a successful extraction flows on to cleanup →
  embed → enrichment without this worker knowing the next step.

  `unique` keeps at most one active job per document, so the prepare page's
  Extract button and the auto pipeline can't spawn parallel extractors.
