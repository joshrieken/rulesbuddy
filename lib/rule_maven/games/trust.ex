  Reputation-weighted trust scoring for pooled Q&A.

  Two derived, denormalized signals:

    * `users.reputation` — earned from the net votes a user's authored answers
      receive, plus a bonus per answer promoted to the community pool. Drives how
      much each of that user's future votes counts.
    * `questions_log.trust_score` — the single ranking/promotion signal for a row:
      reputation-weighted net votes + a citation bonus, with `verified` acting as
      an admin override that floors the score at the top tier.

  `favorited` is a private bookmark and is deliberately excluded from trust.

  Vote weights are a **snapshot**: each vote stores the caster's weight at the

  on this row's own votes, so it is fully recomputed whenever those votes change
  and never goes stale from a *different* row's activity. (Deriving weights from
  live reputation instead would couple every row to global reputation state and
  require re-scoring every row a user ever voted on each time their reputation
  moved — not worth it.)
