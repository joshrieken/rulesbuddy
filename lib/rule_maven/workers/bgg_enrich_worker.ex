  Durable BoardGameGeek enrichment. Previously `enrich_game(force: true)` ran
  synchronously inside the LiveView `handle_info`, blocking the whole LiveView
  process during the (throttled, retry-prone) BGG API call. This moves it to an
  Oban job that survives restarts and broadcasts `{:bgg_enriched, game_id,
  :ok | {:error, reason}}` on `topic/1` so the page can refresh when it lands.
