defmodule RuleMaven.Voices do
  @moduledoc """
  Persona voices: cached, in-character restyles of canonical answers.

  The canonical answer (the pooled, citation-bearing source of truth) is never
  modified. A voice is a *rendering* of that prose — same facts, same numbers,
  different tone. Each `(answer, voice)` restyle is generated once and cached in
  `answer_voices`, so switching between voices is free after first touch and the
  cache is shared across every viewer.

  The restyler only ever sees the already-grounded answer text — never the
  rulebook — so it cannot introduce new rules. Citations, page numbers, and the
  verdict stamp render from the canonical row and are intentionally left neutral.
