defmodule RuleMaven.Workers.CleanupWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Durable, restart-survivable rulebook text cleanup.

  Cleans each page's extracted text via the LLM and writes the result straight
  into `Document.pages[].cleaned` as it finishes, broadcasting per page so the
  LiveView swaps that page live. Because each finished page is persisted
  immediately, a server restart loses no completed work: Oban re-runs the
  orphaned job, and `perform/1` only processes pages whose `cleaned` is still
  nil — so it resumes exactly where it left off.

  `unique` keeps at most one active job per document, so a double-click or a
  remount can't spawn parallel cleaners racing on the same embeds_many column.
