    A single first-class rulebook page. `index` is the 0-based physical order,
    `sheet` the physical PDF sheet number, `printed` the rulebook's printed page
    number (nil when undetected).

    Two text layers (no markers): `text` is the read-only original from
    extraction, `cleaned` the editable working copy (auto-populated by Clean Up,
    then hand-editable; nil until cleaned/edited). The effective text used
    everywhere downstream is `cleaned || text`.

    Extraction provenance (nil on pre-existing pages): `confidence` is the
    quality-gate score 0.0–1.0, `lane` the ladder rung that produced the text
    ("text_layer" | "ocr" | "vision" | "ensemble"), `source` the winning reader.
    Low-confidence pages are surfaced for review and can be re-extracted a tier up.
