  Durable rulebook download + text extraction. Fetches a PDF (by URL or by
  asking the LLM to find one), extracts its text, and persists a rulebook
  source (Document). Broadcasts `{:download_done, game_id, pdf_path}` or
  `{:download_error, game_id, reason}` on `topic/1` so the game form reloads
  its sources live.

  Replaces inline work in the LiveView process: a server restart mid-download
  no longer strands the spinner — Oban re-runs the orphaned job. `unique` keeps
  one download per game at a time (the form disables the buttons while running).
