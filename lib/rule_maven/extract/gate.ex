defmodule RuleMaven.Extract.Gate do
  @moduledoc """
  Quality gate for page extraction — the accuracy/cost engine.

  Two cheap, independent reads of a page (text layer or OCR vs. cheap vision)
  are scored here. Strong agreement means the page is at its accuracy ceiling: a
  stronger (costly) model can't change a result two independent methods already
  concur on, so we stop. Disagreement is the *only* place escalation can change
  the answer, so the gate is **recall-biased** — when in doubt, escalate. A
  wasted escalation costs money but no accuracy; a skipped one costs accuracy, so
  the asymmetry is deliberate.

  Pure and dictionary-free: signals are agreement (token-set overlap), coverage
  (length parity, the silent-drop catcher), and wordishness (symbol-soup
  detector). Calibration with a real lexicon is a later phase.
