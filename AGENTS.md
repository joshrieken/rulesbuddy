## Project

Rules Buddy — Phoenix LiveView PWA for board game rules Q&A.
Ask questions in plain English, get answers grounded in rulebook text.

## Quick Index

| Topic | File |
|-------|------|
| Project overview, tech stack, setup, safety rails | [`.agents/overview.md`](.agents/overview.md) |
| Codebase map (every module, file, function) | [`.agents/codebase-map.md`](.agents/codebase-map.md) |
| Data flows (ask question, save rulebook, FAQ cluster) | [`.agents/data-flows.md`](.agents/data-flows.md) |
| Conventions (formatting, testing, git, LiveView patterns) | [`.agents/conventions.md`](.agents/conventions.md) |

## How to Use

1. Read this file first.
2. Scan the codebase map to find target files for your task.
3. Load only those files. Do NOT scan the entire tree.
4. Use the data flows doc to understand how things connect.

## Self-Maintenance (mandatory)

After every code change, update the relevant doc. At minimum:

- **New module/file added** → add row to `.agents/codebase-map.md`
- **Module removed or renamed** → update all references in `.agents/codebase-map.md` and `.agents/data-flows.md`
- **Public function added/changed** → update Key Functions column in `.agents/codebase-map.md`
- **Line count changed significantly** → update Lines column
- **New data flow or changed flow** → update `.agents/data-flows.md`
- **New convention or changed workflow** → update `.agents/conventions.md`

**Process:** After `mix test` passes and before commit, check:
1. Did I create, rename, or delete any module? → update map
2. Did I change any public function signature? → update map
3. Did I change a data flow? → update flows doc
4. Did the line count change by >50 lines? → update map

If answer is yes to any, update the doc *in the same commit*.

## Common Commands

- Compile (strict): `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`
- Run all tests: `mix test`
- Run one test: `mix test test/path/to/file_test.exs:42`
- Format fix: `mix format`
- Static analysis: `mix credo --strict`
- Full pre-commit check: `mix format && mix credo --strict && mix test`

**Skip tests** when only `.md`, `.agents/`, or doc files changed. No code path affected.

## Commit Discipline

- Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`
- Atomic commits, imperative mood
- Never commit/push without being explicitly asked
- Run full pre-commit check before every commit
- **Commit after completing work.** Do not leave uncommitted changes at session end.
