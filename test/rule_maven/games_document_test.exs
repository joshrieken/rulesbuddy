    Setup: Each player receives five cards from the deck. Place the remaining
    cards in the center of the table. The youngest player goes first. Shuffle
    all remaining cards thoroughly before starting.

    Turn Structure: On your turn, draw one card and play one card. Cards have
    various effects that may modify the rules. After playing, pass the turn
    clockwise. You must announce your action before drawing additional cards.
    The maximum hand size is seven cards at all times during the game.

    Combat: When two players occupy the same space, combat begins immediately.
    Each player rolls a die and adds their strength modifier. The higher total
    wins the combat. The loser retreats to the nearest empty space.

    Winning: The first player to collect ten victory points wins the game.
    Victory points are earned by completing quests and defeating opponents.
    A player may hold at most five quests at any time during the game session.

    Additional Rules: Players cannot trade cards during combat rounds. Trading
    is only allowed during the planning phase at the start of each turn.
