defmodule RuleMaven.Extract.Critic do
  @moduledoc """
  Adversarial verification loop for an escalated page — the runtime adversary.

  Given a page image and a candidate transcription, a critic model hunts for
  concrete defects (missing text, hallucinations, wrong numbers, dropped table
  rows, mis-ordered columns). If it finds any, the page is re-transcribed with
  those defects as targeted guidance, then re-critiqued. The loop runs until the
  critic is satisfied or `max_rounds` is hit — bounded so cost stays finite, and
  run only on escalated (disagreement) pages so the spend lands where accuracy is
  actually at risk.

  The model calls are injectable (`:critique_fn`, `:transcribe_fn`) so the loop
  is unit-testable without a network. Defaults wire to `RuleMaven.LLM`.

  A critic *failure* never blocks: we treat it as "no defects found" and keep the
  candidate, because a flaky critic must not throw away a usable transcription.
